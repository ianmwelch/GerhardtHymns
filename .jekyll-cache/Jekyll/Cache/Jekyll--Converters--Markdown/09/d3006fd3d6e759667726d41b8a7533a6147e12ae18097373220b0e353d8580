  <li>Say with what salutations<br />
Shall I Thine advent greet?<br />
Desire of all the nations,<br />
My Joy and Succour meet!<br />
O Jesus! Jesus! lead me<br />
On by Thy blessèd light;<br />
What’s Thy delight thus guide me<br />
To understand aright.</li>
  <li>With palms doth Zion meet Thee,<br />
Spreads branches in the way;<br />
To raise my soul to greet Thee<br />
Glad psalms I’ll sing to-day.<br />
My heart shall blossom ever,<br />
O’erflow with praises new,<br />
And from Thy name shall never<br />
Withhold the honour due.</li>
  <li>What hast Thou e’er neglected<br />
For my good here below?<br />
When heart and soul dejected,<br />
Were sunk in deepest woe,<br />
When from Thy presence hidden,<br />
Where peace and pleasure are,<br />
Thou camest, and hast bidden<br />
Me joy again, my Star!</li>
  <li>In bitter bondage lying,<br />
Thou com’st and sett’st me free;<br />
’Neath scorn and shame when sighing,<br />
Thou com’st and raisest me.<br />
Thy grace high honour gives me,<br />
Abundance doth bestow,<br />
That wastes not, nor deceives me<br />
As earthly riches do.</li>
  <li>No other impulse led Thee<br />
To leave Thy throne above,<br />
Upon Thine errand sped Thee,<br />
But world-embracing love!<br />
A love that deeply feeleth<br />
The wants and woes of men,<br />
No tongue its fulness telleth,<br />
It passeth human ken.</li>
  <li>In thy heart be this written,<br />
Thou much afflicted band!<br />
Who evermore art smitten<br />
With griefs on every hand.<br />
Fear not! let nothing grieve thee,<br />
For help is at thy door,<br />
He’ll consolation give thee,<br />
Oil in thy wounds will pour.</li>
  <li>No care nor effort either<br />
Is needed day and night,<br />
How thou may’st draw Him hither<br />
In thine own strength and might.<br />
He comes, He comes with gladness!<br />
O’erflows with love to thee,<br />
To chase away the sadness<br />
He knows oppresseth thee.</li>
  <li>Sin’s debt, the mighty burden<br />
Let not thy heart affright;<br />
The Lord will freely pardon,<br />
His grace will cover quite.<br />
He comes! He comes! Salvation<br />
Proclaiming everywhere,<br />
Secures His chosen nation<br />
Their heritage so fair!</li>
  <li>Thy foes why should they move thee?<br />
Their wiles and rage are vain,<br />
Thy Saviour, who doth love thee,<br />
Will scatter them again.<br />
He comes! a Conq’ror glorious,<br />
He’ll scatter every band<br />
Of foes—His course victorious<br />
Too few they’re to withstand.</li>
  <li>He comes to judge each nation;<br />
   Who curs’d Him, curse shall He;<br />
   With grace and consolation,<br />
   Who lov’d, receiv’d shall be.<br />
   Oh! come, Thou Sun, and lead us<br />
   To everlasting light,<br />
   Up to Thy mansions guide us<br />
   Of glory and delight.</li>
