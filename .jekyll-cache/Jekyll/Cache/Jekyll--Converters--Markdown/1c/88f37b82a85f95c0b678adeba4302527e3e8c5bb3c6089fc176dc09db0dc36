  <li>
    <p>Lord, how shall I receive Thee<br />
Thou joy of all the earth,<br />
What entertainment give Thee<br />
Befitting Thy great worth?<br />
O kindle, Jesu, Jesu,<br />
Thy lamp within my breast,<br />
And show me how to please Thee,<br />
And entertain Thee best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Sion came to meet Thee,<br />
She strewed Thy way with palms,<br />
And I would also greet Thee<br />
With joyful songs and psalms;<br />
My heart, fresh trophies bringing<br />
To scatter on Thy way.<br />
Shall break forth into singing.<br />
And praise Thee night and day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What comfort have I wanted<br />
Thy pity could bestow,<br />
When soul and body panted<br />
Beneath their weight of woe?<br />
When from me had been taken<br />
My dream of earthly bliss,<br />
Thou camest to awaken<br />
A better joy than this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When left to pine and languish<br />
In bonds and misery,<br />
â€˜Twas Thou who sawâ€™st my anguish,<br />
And came to set me free.<br />
Thou raisedst me to honour,<br />
And gavâ€™st me riches too,<br />
Which fly not from their owner,<br />
As earthly riches do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naught, naught but true compassion,<br />
And pure unbounded love,<br />
Drew Thee, for our salvation.<br />
From Thy bright realms above;<br />
A love which comprehended<br />
Within its wide embrace<br />
A world which had offended,<br />
The sins of all our race.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let this be plainly written,<br />
Ye mourners, on your heart,<br />
When it is forely smitten,<br />
And wrung with keenest smart;<br />
Fear not, nor be dejected,<br />
Your Helper is at hand,<br />
The Saviour long expected<br />
Eâ€™en at the door doth stand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ye need not so bestir you,<br />
And labour day and night,<br />
As though to draw Him near you<br />
By your own strength and might.<br />
He comes, He comes with healing<br />
For all the countless woes<br />
Which human hearts are feeling,<br />
Whereof He so well knows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor need the sins which grieve you<br />
Your trembling souls appal;<br />
No, Jesus will forgive you,<br />
His grace can hide them all.<br />
He comes to bring salvation<br />
To every contrite heart,<br />
On earth sweet consolation,<br />
In heaven a better part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What though the proud blasphemer<br />
Both threats and wiles employ,<br />
A word from your Redeemer<br />
Shall him at once destroy.<br />
He comes, He comes with glory<br />
And majesty arrayed,<br />
Great kings shall bow before Him,<br />
His foes all flee dismayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He comes to judge the scorners<br />
   Who have despised His grace,<br />
   And comfort pious mourners<br />
   Who humbly feek His face.<br />
   Ah! come, sweet Sun, and light us<br />
   To those bright realms above,<br />
   And with Thyself unite us,<br />
   Who art all Light and Love.</p>
  </li>
