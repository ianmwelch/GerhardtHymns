  <li>
    <p>Why without, then, art Thou staying,<br />
Blessed of the Lord from far?<br />
Enter now, no more delaying,<br />
Let it please Theeâ€”Thou, my Star!<br />
Thou, my Jesus, Friend indeed,<br />
Helper in the hour of need!<br />
Saviour! ease the wounds that pain me,<br />
Let Thy comforts rich sustain me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lord, my wounds are pain and sorrow,<br />
That the hammer of the law<br />
With its terrors, night and morrow,<br />
Causeth, filling me with awe.<br />
Oh! the dreadful thunder peals<br />
When His anger God reveals,<br />
All my blood to tingle making,<br />
And my heartâ€™s foundation shaking!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then with wiles the great deceiver<br />
Would to me all grace deny,<br />
Saying, in the hell for ever<br />
That torments him, I must be.<br />
But I suffer sorer pangs,<br />
For with poisonâ€™d serpent fangs<br />
Doth my conscience gnawing, tearing,<br />
Stir remorse beyond all bearing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do I seek my woe to soften,<br />
And to lessen pain desire,<br />
With the world commingling often,<br />
Sink I quite into the mire.<br />
There is comfort that deceives,<br />
Joy that by my mischance lives,<br />
Helpers there who only grieve me,<br />
Friends who only mock and leave me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing in the world endureth,<br />
Or the soulâ€™s thirst can allay;<br />
Fleeting is the rank that lureth.<br />
Have I riches? What are they<br />
Better than small dust of earth?<br />
Have I pleasure? Whatâ€™s it worth?<br />
What to-day my heart doth gladden,<br />
That to-morrow doth not sadden?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comfort, joy, in boundless measure,<br />
Storâ€™d, Lord Jesus, are in Thee,<br />
Pastures of unfading pleasure,<br />
Where we roam and feast so free.<br />
Light of joy! illumine me<br />
Ere my heart quite broken be!<br />
Jesus, let mine eyes behold Thee;<br />
Lord, refresh me and uphold me!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heart, rejoice, for He doth hear thee,<br />
And He visits thee again;<br />
Now thy Saviour draweth near thee,<br />
Bid Him gladsome welcome then,<br />
And prepare thee for thy guest,<br />
Enter thou into His rest,<br />
While with open heart receiving,<br />
Tell Him all that is thee grieving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lo! the things that seemâ€™d to hinder<br />
How they all fall out for good.<br />
Hark! how He in accents tender<br />
Comforts thee in gracious mood.<br />
Ceasâ€™d the dragon has to roar,<br />
Scheming, raging, now no more.<br />
His advantages forsake him,<br />
He must to thâ€™ abyss betake him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now thy life is calm and even,<br />
All thy heartâ€™s desire is thine;<br />
Christ Himself to thee hath given<br />
All He hathâ€”exhaustless mine!<br />
His grace is thy fairest crown,<br />
Thou His seat art and His throne;<br />
With Himself as one He makes thee,<br />
Freely to His bosom takes thee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God His golden-curtainâ€™d Heaven<br />
   Spreadeth to encompass thee!<br />
   Lest thou shouldst away be driven<br />
   By thy raging enemy.<br />
   Angel hosts keep watch and ward<br />
   At thy side and are thy guard;<br />
   Lest in journeys aught should hurt thee,<br />
   By the way their arms support thee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the ill thou hast done ever<br />
It is now remitted quite;<br />
Godâ€™s love thee doth now deliver<br />
From sinâ€™s tyrant powâ€™r and might.<br />
Christ the Prince hath won the day,<br />
Rise against thee what ill may,<br />
He, to purest good converting,<br />
Robbeth of the powâ€™r of hurting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All for thine advantage proveth,<br />
Eâ€™en what hurtful may appear.<br />
Christ accepteth thee and loveth,<br />
And His thoughts are all sincere.<br />
Thou in turn but faithful be,<br />
Then shall certainly by thee,<br />
With the angel hosts in Heaven,<br />
Thanks and praise for aye be given.</p>
  </li>
