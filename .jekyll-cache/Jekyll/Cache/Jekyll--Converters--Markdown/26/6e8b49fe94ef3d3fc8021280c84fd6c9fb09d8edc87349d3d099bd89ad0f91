  <li>
    <p>Oh, how shall I receive thee,<br />
How greet thee, Lord, aright?<br />
All nations long to see thee,<br />
My hope, my heartâ€™s delight!<br />
Oh, kindle, Lord most holy,<br />
Thy lamp within my breast,<br />
To do in spirit lowly<br />
All that may please thee best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thy Zion palms is strewing,<br />
And branches fresh and fair;<br />
My heart, its powers renewing,<br />
An anthem shall prepare:<br />
My soul puts off her sadness<br />
Thy glories to proclaim;<br />
With all her strength and gladness<br />
She fain would serve thy name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I lay in fetters groaning,<br />
Thou comâ€™st to set me free!<br />
I stood, my shame bemoaning,<br />
Thou comâ€™st to honour me!<br />
A glory dost thou give me,<br />
A treasure safe on high,<br />
That will not fail nor leave me,<br />
As earthly riches fly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Love caused thy incarnation,<br />
Love brought thee down to me;<br />
Thy thirst for my salvation<br />
Procured my liberty:<br />
Oh, love beyond all telling!<br />
That led thee to embrace,<br />
Oh, love all love excelling!<br />
Our lost and fallen race!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rejoice, then, ye sad-hearted<br />
Who sit in deepest gloom,<br />
Who mourn oâ€™er joys departed,<br />
And tremble at your doom:<br />
He only who can cheer you,<br />
Is standing at the door;<br />
He brings his pity near you,<br />
And bids you weep no more.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
