  <li>In prayâ€™r your voices raise ye<br />
To God, and Him now praise ye,<br />
Who to our life from heaven<br />
All needed strength hath given.</li>
  <li>The stream of years is flowing,<br />
And we are onward going,<br />
From old to new surviving,<br />
And by His mercy thriving.</li>
  <li>In woe we often languish,<br />
And pass through times of anguish,<br />
When fearful war aboundeth,<br />
That earth itself surroundeth.</li>
  <li>As faithful mother keepeth<br />
Guard while her infant sleepeth,<br />
And all its grief assuageth<br />
When angry tempest rageth;</li>
  <li>So God His children shieldeth,<br />
Them full protection yieldeth;<br />
When need and woe distress them,<br />
His loving arms caress them.</li>
  <li>In vain is all our doing,<br />
The labour weâ€™re pursuing<br />
In our hands prospers never,<br />
Unless God watcheth ever.</li>
  <li>Our song to Thee ascendeth,<br />
Who every day defendeth<br />
Us, and whose arm averteth<br />
The pain our hearts that hurteth.</li>
  <li>O God of mercy! hear us;<br />
Our Father! be Thou near us;<br />
â€™Mid crosses and in sadness<br />
Be Thou our Spring of gladness.</li>
  <li>To me and all be given,<br />
Who from the heart have striven<br />
To gain Thy benediction,<br />
Hearts patient in affliction.</li>
  <li>Oh! close the gates of sorrow,<br />
   And by a glorious morrow<br />
   Of peace, may places saddenâ€™d<br />
   By bloodshed dire be gladdenâ€™d.</li>
  <li>With richest blessings crown us,<br />
   In all our ways, Lord! own us;<br />
   Give grace, who grace bestowest<br />
   To all, eâ€™en to the lowest.</li>
  <li>Of all forlorn be Father,<br />
   All erring ones ingather,<br />
   And of the poor and needy<br />
   Be Thou the succour speedy.</li>
  <li>Grace show to all afflicted,<br />
   And to all souls dejected,<br />
   By melancholy haunted,<br />
   May happy thoughts be granted.</li>
  <li>All earthly gifts excelling,<br />
   The Holy Ghost indwelling,<br />
   Give us to make us glorious,<br />
   And lead to Thee victorious.</li>
  <li>All this Thy hand bestoweth,<br />
   Thou Life! whence our life floweth,<br />
   Thus Thou Thy people meetest<br />
   With New Yearâ€™s blessing greetest.</li>
