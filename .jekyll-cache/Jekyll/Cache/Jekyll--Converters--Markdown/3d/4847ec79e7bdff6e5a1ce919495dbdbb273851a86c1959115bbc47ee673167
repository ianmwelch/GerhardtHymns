  <li>Year after year commenceth,<br />
And, as our life advanceth,<br />
We, strength from Christ deriving,<br />
Each year by faith are thriving.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>As, in tempestuous weather,<br />
A kind and tender mother<br />
Her babe from harm protecteth,<br />
And safely home conducteth;</li>
  <li>So shelters Christ our Saviour<br />
His children by his favor,<br />
And proves in each temptation<br />
Their refuge and salvation.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Lord, grant thy benediction<br />
   To evâ€™ry thought and action;<br />
   On youth and age declining,<br />
   Thou Sun of grace be shining.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>â€‹</li>
  <li>O keep our souls and senses<br />
   Under the influences<br />
   Of thy most Holy Spirit,<br />
   Until we heavâ€™n inherit.</li>
  <li>O God of our salvation,<br />
   Withhold no kind donation<br />
   From us, but let us savor<br />
   In this new year thy favor.</li>
</ol>
