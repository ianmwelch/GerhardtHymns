  <li>How shall I meet my Saviour?<br />
How shall I welcome Thee?<br />
What Manner of Behaviour<br />
Is now requirâ€™d of me?<br />
Let thine Illumination<br />
Set Heart and Hands aright,<br />
That this my Preparation<br />
Be pleasing in thy Sight.</li>
  <li>Thy Sionâ€™s strowing Flowers<br />
For Thee to tread upon;<br />
Iâ€™ll raise with all my Powers<br />
More Notes than Unison,<br />
To praise the King of Glory<br />
With Psalms of Melody,<br />
Tâ€™improve the Sacred Story<br />
In Rhimes and Harmony.</li>
  <li>What hast thou not devised,<br />
Lord! to retrieve my Loss,<br />
When I was so disguised<br />
By Sin, and Hellish Dross;<br />
The Sense of lost Salvation<br />
Quite drove me to Despair,<br />
But thy own Incarnation<br />
Brought my Redemption near.</li>
  <li>I lay in Fetters groaning,<br />
Thou camâ€™st to set me free;<br />
My Shame I was bemoaning,<br />
With Grace thou cloathedst me<br />
And raisest me to Glory,<br />
Endowâ€™st me with thy Bliss,<br />
Which is not transitory<br />
As worldly Treasure is.</li>
  <li>What causâ€™d thy Incarnation?<br />
What brought Thee down to me?<br />
Thy Love to my Salvation<br />
Contrivâ€™d my Liberty.<br />
O Love, beyond Expression!<br />
Wherewith thou dost embrace<br />
Mankind in its Digression<br />
From Thee, the Source of Grace.</li>
  <li>Let this Consideration<br />
Chear up your troubled Heart,<br />
Ye Sons of Desolation!<br />
That feel the sinful Smart;<br />
Take Courage, your Salvation<br />
Stands waiting at the Door,<br />
The Gospel Consolation<br />
Is nearer than before.</li>
  <li>You need not strive nor labour<br />
With any Human Strength<br />
To draw his Love and Favour<br />
To you desired Length;<br />
He comes and shews how willing<br />
He is to bless you all,<br />
The Law he is fulfilling<br />
To save you from the Fall.</li>
  <li>Be not cast down, nor frighted<br />
At Sin, thoâ€™ neâ€™er so great;<br />
No! Jesus is delighted<br />
The Greatest Guilt tâ€™abate.<br />
He comes to raise all Sinners<br />
From Death to Life and Bliss,<br />
And make us new Beginners<br />
To taste what Jesus is.</li>
  <li>You dare not fear the Clamour<br />
Of Satan and his Clan,<br />
The Word, his powâ€™rful Hammer,<br />
Destroys their wicked Plan.<br />
He comes as King of Glory,<br />
Whose Nod confounds their Host;<br />
He carries all before ye,<br />
And baffles all their Boast.</li>
  <li>He comes to pass his Sentence<br />
   On all his Enemies.<br />
   But those of True Repentance<br />
   Shall meet with Love and Peace.<br />
   Come Prince of Grace and Wonder!<br />
   Fetch thy Beloved Home,<br />
   Reveal thy Glories yonder,<br />
   Thy longing Spouse says: Come!</li>
