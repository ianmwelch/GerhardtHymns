<p><strong>1. Johann CrÃ¼gerâ€™s</strong> <a href="/sources/praxis"><em>Praxis pietatis melica (1649 and later editions)</em></a></p>

<p>A contemporary and friend of Paul Gerhardt, Johann CrÃ¼ger was the first to publish Gerhardtâ€™s hymns in his <em>Praxis pietatis melica</em>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Johann Ebelingâ€™s</strong> <a href="/sources/pauli_gerhardi"><em>Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten (1667 and later editions)</em></a></p>

<p>Johann Ebeling was a close friend of Gerhardt and succeeded CrÃ¼ger as cantor at the church of St. Nicholas in Berlin. He devoted his book <em>Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten</em> solely to the hymns of Paul Gerhardt.</p>

<p><strong>3. Johann Feustkingâ€™s</strong> <a href="/sources/pauli_feustking"><em>Pauli Gerhardi Geistreiche Hauss- und Kirchen-Lieder (1707 and later editions)</em></a></p>

<p>The son of Paul Gerhardt, Paul Friedrich Gerhardt, left the last will of his father including all of his hymns to superintendent Feustking in Zerbst. Paul Gerhardtâ€™s songs were published in a book by Feustking with the last will printed within the preface.</p>
