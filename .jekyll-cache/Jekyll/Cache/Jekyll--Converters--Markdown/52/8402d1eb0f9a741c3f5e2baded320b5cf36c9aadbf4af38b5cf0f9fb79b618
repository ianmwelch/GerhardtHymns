<ol>
  <li>Now let us come and go<br />
with singing and praying<br />
to the Lord our life,<br />
who has given us strength up to this point.</li>
  <li>We journey to and fro and wander<br />
from one year to the next,<br />
we live and thrive<br />
from the old to the new;</li>
  <li>through so much fear and plagues,<br />
through shivering and trembling,<br />
through war and great horrors,<br />
that cover the whole world.</li>
  <li>For just like faithful mothers<br />
in severe storms<br />
here on earth, the little children<br />
are diligently protected:</li>
  <li>So also, at the very least,<br />
God keeps his children<br />
[safe] sitting on his lap<br />
when distress and tribulation strike.</li>
  <li>O Protector of our lives,<br />
everything we do and make<br />
is surely in vain<br />
unless your eyes watch over.</li>
  <li>Blessed is your faithfulness,<br />
which is new each morning,<br />
Praise be to your strong hands,<br />
which mend our heartache.</li>
  <li>We ask you, O Father, that you<br />
remain of fountain of joy<br />
in the midst of our sufferings<br />
and the cross we bear.</li>
  <li>Give me and all those<br />
whose hearts yearn<br />
for you and your favor,<br />
a heart that is patient.</li>
  <li>Close the gates of lament<br />
  and let streams of joy<br />
  flow over â€¨all the places<br />
  that have endured so much bloodshed.</li>
  <li>Give your gentle blessing<br />
   to all of our ways,â€¨<br />
   and let the radiance of your grace<br />
   shine on both great and small.</li>
  <li>Be a father for the abandoned,<br />
   counselor for the guilty,<br />
   â€¨gift for those without aid,<br />
   and a possession for the poor.</li>
  <li>Be a gracious help to all who are sick<br />
   and give cheerful thoughts<br />
   â€¨to the afflicted souls<br />
   that are tormented with sadness.</li>
  <li>And finally, most importantly of all,<br />
   fill us with your Spirit,<br />
   that he may adorn us with splendor<br />
   and lead us heavenward.</li>
  <li>Grant all this,<br />
   O Life of my life,<br />
   to me and to the multitudes of Christians<br />
   this blessed new year.</li>
</ol>
