<br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Christians all, with one accord,<br />
Come and sing before the Lord,<br />
Who for us so long hath cared,<br />
and our lives in mercy spared!</li>
  <li>Thus from year to year we live,<br />
Store and basket yearly thrive,<br />
Old years go, and new ones come,<br />
Yet no ill befalls our home.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>As, when thunder rolls on high,<br />
Mothers watch the threatening sky,<br />
Hug their babes with fond caress,<br />
Closer still and closer press:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So doth God with tender love<br />
Guard his children from above,<br />
Lets them, when dark storms are nigh,<br />
To his wings for shelter fly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If our Watchman shut his eyes,<br />
Late to rest and early rise,<br />
Precious time, and toil, and cost,<br />
Are but wealth and labour lost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God his goodness doth renew<br />
Day by day, like morning dew;<br />
Still performs a Fatherâ€™s part,<br />
Sooths the anguish of the heart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we cry, O Father, hear!<br />
Help us every cross to bear;<br />
When the worldâ€™s cold looks annoy,<br />
Be a living Spring of joy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give to us, and give to all<br />
Who on Thee sincerely call,<br />
Who thy grace with longing seek,<br />
Patient hearts, good, loving, meek!</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Let thy grace illume our days,<br />
Bless and prosper all our ways;<br />
Early rain bestow and late<br />
On the small and on the great!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the orphans Father be,<br />
Sight to those who cannot see;<br />
Be Thou Riches to the poor,<br />
To the houseless open Door!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lord, in sickness make our bed,<br />
Raise the faint and drooping head;<br />
When the road seems drear and long,<br />
Cheer us on with grateful song.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, what we need the most,<br />
Fill us with the Holy Ghost,<br />
Who will earthly wants provide,<br />
And to heaven our footsteps guide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Sow in every heart good seed,<br />
Give to each what each may need!<br />
Thus to Christians far and near <br />
Bless this new and happy year!</li>
</ol>
