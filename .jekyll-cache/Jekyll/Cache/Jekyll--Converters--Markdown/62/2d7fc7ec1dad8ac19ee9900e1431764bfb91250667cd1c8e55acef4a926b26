  <li>Now let each humble creature<br />
Adore the God of nature,<br />
For his kind preservation<br />
And daily new creation.</li>
  <li>We stretch our life and wander<br />
From year to year, and yonder<br />
We live, keep on improving,<br />
Till date and year‚Äôs removing.</li>
  <li>Thro‚Äô pains, thro‚Äô wants and errors,<br />
Thro‚Äô dismal wars and terrors,<br />
Thro‚Äô crosses, strifes and hurry,<br />
That seem the world to worry.</li>
  <li>As in tempestuous weathers<br />
The kind and carefull mothers,<br />
With nature‚Äôs swift affection<br />
Run to their babes protection.</li>
  <li>No less our heav‚Äônly lover<br />
Is present with his cover,<br />
When stormy winds are blowing,<br />
To save his children going.</li>
  <li>Great guardian of our being,<br />
In vain is our foreseeing,<br />
With all our best care-taking,<br />
Except thine eyes be waking.</li>
  <li>Blest be thy gracious favour,<br />
Each morn renews its favour;<br />
Blest be the hands asswaging<br />
All heart-akes ne‚Äôer so raging.</li>
  <li>Hear, father, our petition,<br />
Relieve our weak condition<br />
Be still the source of gladness<br />
In all our grief and sadness.</li>
  <li>Grant all thy true sojourners<br />
And heavy laden mourners,<br />
That own thy visitations,<br />
An heart endo‚Äôd with patience.</li>
  <li>Remove our sad disorders,<br />
  And make in all our borders<br />
  Thy peace and truth together<br />
  To meet and kiss each other.</li>
  <li>Lord grant thy benedictions<br />
   To all good thoughts and actions,<br />
   To youth, and age declining,<br />
   Thy gracious sun be shining.</li>
  <li>Be thou the orphan‚Äôs father;<br />
   The straying draw together;<br />
   Relieve the poor and scanty,<br />
   To all in want give plenty.</li>
  <li>Heal all, the sick and wounded;<br />
   The souls that are surrounded<br />
   With fearful thoughts and terrors,<br />
   Lord, rescue from their errors.</li>
  <li>But chiefly grant thy Spirit,<br />
   Thro‚Äô Christ‚Äôs all saving merit,<br />
   To fill us with such graces<br />
   As lead to thine embraces.</li>
  <li>All this, we pray, be giving,<br />
   O life of all that‚Äôs living!<br />
   To us and all that favor<br />
   Thy New Year‚Äôs gift and favor.</li>
