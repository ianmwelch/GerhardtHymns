  <li>How shall I meet my Saviour?<br />
How shall I welcome Thee?<br />
What Manner of Behaviour<br />
Is now requir’d of me?<br />
Let thine Illumination<br />
Set Heart and Hands aright,<br />
That this my Preparation<br />
Be pleasing in thy Sight.</li>
  <li>Whilst with the gayest Flowers<br />
Thy Sion strews the Way,<br />
I’ll raise with all my Powers<br />
To Thee, a grateful Lay:<br />
To Thee the King of Glory<br />
I’ll tune a Song Divine;<br />
And make thy Love’s bright Story<br />
In graceful Numbers shine.</li>
  <li>What hast thou not performed,<br />
Lord, to retrieve my Loss,<br />
While I was so deformed<br />
By Sin and Hellish Dross?<br />
The Sense of lost Salvation<br />
Quite drove me to Despair,<br />
But thy own Incarnation<br />
Brought my Redemption near.</li>
  <li>I lay in Fetters groaning,<br />
Thou cam’st to set me free.<br />
My Shame I was bemoaning;<br />
With Grace thou cloathedst me.<br />
Thou raisest me to Glory;<br />
Endow’st me with thy Bliss,<br />
Which is not transitory,<br />
As worldly Treasure is.</li>
  <li>What caus’d thy Incarnation?<br />
What brought Thee down to me?<br />
Thy Love to my Salvation<br />
Contriv’d my Liberty.<br />
O Love, beyond Expression!<br />
Wherewith thou dost embrace<br />
Mankind in its Digression<br />
From Thee, the Source of Grace.</li>
  <li>Let this Consideration<br />
Heal up your Wounds within,<br />
Ye Sons of Desolation,<br />
That feel the Smart of Sin.<br />
Take Courage, your Salvation<br />
Stands waiting at the Door;<br />
The Gospel Consolation<br />
Is nearer than before.</li>
  <li>‘Tis none of your Endeavour,<br />
Nor any Mortal Care<br />
Cou’d draw his Sov’reign Favour<br />
To Sinners in Despair;<br />
Uncall’d he comes with Gladness<br />
To save you from the Fall,<br />
And cure all Grief and Sadness<br />
You’re still opprest withal.</li>
  <li>Be not cast down nor frighted<br />
At Sin, tho’ ne’er so great;<br />
No! Jesus is delighted<br />
The Greatest to remit.<br />
He comes repenting Sinners<br />
With Life and Love to crown;<br />
And make them happy Winners<br />
Of Glory like his own.</li>
  <li>Then fear not ye the Clamour<br />
Of Satan and his Clan;<br />
The Word, his pow’rful Hammer,<br />
Destroys their wicked Plan.<br />
He comes as King of Glory,<br />
Whose Nod confounds their Host;<br />
He carries all before ye,<br />
And baffles all their Boast.</li>
  <li>He comes to pass his Sentence<br />
  On all his Enemies.<br />
  But Children of Repentance<br />
  Shall meet with Love and Peace.<br />
  Come, Prince of Grace and Wonder!<br />
  Fetch thy Beloved Home;<br />
  Reveal thy Glories yonder;<br />
  Thy longing Spouse says, Come!</li>
