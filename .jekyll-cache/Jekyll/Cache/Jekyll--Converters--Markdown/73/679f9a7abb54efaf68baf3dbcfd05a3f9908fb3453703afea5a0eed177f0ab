  <li>
    <p>How shall I meet Thee? How my heart<br />
Receive her Lord aright?<br />
Desire of all the earth Thou art!<br />
My hope, my sole delight!<br />
Kindle the lamp, Thou Lord, alone,<br />
Half-dying in my breast,<br />
And make Thy gracious pleasure known<br />
How I may greet Thee best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her budding boughs and fairest palms<br />
Thy Zion strews around;<br />
And songs of praise and sweetest psalms<br />
From my glad heart shall sound.<br />
My desert soul breaks forth in flowers,<br />
Rejoicing in Thy fame;<br />
And puts forth all her sleeping powers,<br />
To honor Jesusâ€™ name.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>In heavy bonds I languished long,<br />
Thou comâ€™st to set me free;<br />
The scorn of every mocking tongueâ€”<br />
Thou comâ€™st to honor me.<br />
A heavenly crown Thou dost bestow,<br />
And gifts of priceless worth,<br />
That vanish not as here below<br />
The riches of the earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nought, nought, dear Lord! had power to move<br />
Thee from Thy rightful place,<br />
Save that almighty wondrous Love<br />
Wherewith Thou dost embrace<br />
This weary world and all her woe,<br />
Her load of grief and ill<br />
And sorrow, more than man can know;<br />
Thy love is deeper still.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>O write this promise in your heart,<br />
Ye sad at heart, with whom<br />
Sorrows fall thick, and joys depart,<br />
And darker grows your gloom.<br />
Despair not, for your help is near,<br />
He standeth at the door<br />
Who best can comfort you and cheer,<br />
He comes, nor stayeth more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vex not your souls with care, nor grieve<br />
And labor longer thus,<br />
As though your arm could ought achieve,<br />
And bring Him down to us!<br />
He comes, He comes with ready will,<br />
By pity moved alone,<br />
All pain to soothe, all tears to still,<br />
To Him they all are known.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ye shall not shrink nor turn aside,<br />
Fearing to see His face,<br />
So deep your sins, for He will hide<br />
The darkest with His grace.<br />
He comes, He comes, to save from sin,<br />
All sinners to release,<br />
For all the sons of God to win<br />
The heritage of peace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why ask ye what the wicked faith.<br />
Why heed his craft and spite?<br />
The Lord destroys him with a breath,<br />
He stands not in His sight.<br />
Christ comes, He comes, as King to reign!<br />
Then gather ye His foes,<br />
From earthâ€™s far corners; yet in vain<br />
Would ye His rule oppose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>He comes to judge the earth, and ye<br />
   Who mockâ€™d Him, feel His wrath;<br />
   But they who loved and fought Him see<br />
   His light oâ€™er all their path.<br />
   O Sun of Righteousness! arise,<br />
   And guide us on our way,<br />
   To yon fair mansion in the skies<br />
   Of joyous, cloudless day.</li>
</ol>
