<br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>With notes of joy and songs of praise,<br />
To God we now draw near,<br />
The Source and Author of our days,<br />
Our Guide from year to year.</li>
  <li>We live and move and journey on,<br />
And hasten on our way,<br />
Through ending years, and years begun,<br />
Advancing day by day.</li>
  <li>Through anguish sore, and sorrow, pain,<br />
Through fearfulness and woe,<br />
Through wars that shake the earth again,<br />
We onward bravely go.</li>
  <li>As by a faithful motherâ€™s care,<br />
When days of trial come,<br />
He guards His earthly children here,<br />
And leads them safely home.</li>
  <li>And on our Heavenly Fatherâ€™s breast,<br />
And in His bosom laid,<br />
His trembling sheep find welcome rest:<br />
â€œâ€˜Tis I, be not afraid!â€</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>We futher supplicate Thy will,<br />
And voice of prayer employ:<br />
â€˜Mid all our sorrows be Thou still<br />
The Source of all our joy!</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>The weary, burdened pilgrims bless,<br />
   The erring ones restore,<br />
   Thou Father of the fatherless,<br />
   Thou Helper of the poor!</li>
  <li>Heal Thou the sick, and help the sad,<br />
   Give thoughts of blessed peace;<br />
   The souls that are cast down make glad<br />
   With holy joyfulness!</li>
  <li>And more than all Thy gifts in worth<br />
   Be Thy good Spirit givâ€™n,<br />
   To beautify our souls on earth,<br />
   And guide us safe to heavâ€™n!</li>
  <li>Whateâ€™er we do, whereâ€™er we go,<br />
   Thou Life of life be near;<br />
   And more than all we ask, bestow,<br />
   And bless this glad New Year!</li>
</ol>
