  <li>
    <p>Lord, how shall I be meeting,<br />
And how shall I embrace<br />
Thee, earth’s desire, when greeting<br />
My soul’s adorning grace!<br />
O Jesus, Jesus holding<br />
Thyself the flame in sight,<br />
Show how, thy beam beholding,<br />
I may, my Lord, delight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fresh palms thy Zion streweth,<br />
And branches ever green,<br />
And psalms my voice reneweth,<br />
To raise my joy serene.<br />
Such budding tribute paying,<br />
My heart shall hymn thy praise,<br />
Thy holy name obeying<br />
With chiefest of my lays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What hast thou left ungranted,<br />
To give me glad relief?<br />
When soul and body panted<br />
In utmost depth of grief,<br />
In hour of degradation,<br />
Thy peace and pity smiled,<br />
Then thou, my soul’s salvation,<br />
Didst happy make thy child.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I lay in slavish mourning,<br />
Thou cam’st to set me free;<br />
I sank in shame and scorning,<br />
Thou cam’st to comfort me.<br />
Thou raised’st me to glory,<br />
Bestowing highest good,<br />
Not frail and transitory,<br />
Like wealth on earth pursued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naught, naught did send thee speeding<br />
From mansions of the skies,<br />
But love all love exceeding,<br />
Love able to comprise<br />
A world in pangs despairing,<br />
Weighed down with thousand woes<br />
That tongue would fail declaring,<br />
But love doth last inclose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grave on your heart this writing,<br />
O band of mourners poor!<br />
With pains and sorrows fighting,<br />
That throng you more and more;<br />
Dismiss the fear that sickens,<br />
For lo! beside you see<br />
Him who your heart now quickens<br />
And comforts; here is he.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should you be detained<br />
In trouble day and night,<br />
As though he must be gained<br />
By arm of human might?<br />
He comes, he comes all willing,<br />
All full of grace and love.<br />
Those woes and troubles stilling,<br />
Well known to him above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor need ye tremble over<br />
The guilt that gives distress.<br />
No! Jesus all will cover<br />
With grace and righteousness:<br />
He comes, he comes, procuring<br />
The peace of sin forgiven,<br />
To all God’s sons securing<br />
Their part and lot in heaven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why heed ye then the crying<br />
Of crafty foemen nigh?<br />
Your Lord shall send them flying<br />
In twinkling of an eye.<br />
He comes, he comes, forever<br />
A King, and earth’s fell band<br />
Shall prove in the endeavor<br />
Too feeble to withstand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He comes to judge the nations,<br />
  “Wroth if they wrathful prove,<br />
  With sweet illuminations<br />
  To those who seek and love.<br />
  Come, come, O Sun eternal,<br />
  And all our souls convey<br />
  To endless bliss supernal,<br />
  In yonder court of day.</p>
  </li>
