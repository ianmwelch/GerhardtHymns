  <li>Wherefore dost Thou, blest of God<br />
Stand without and dwell afar?<br />
Deign to make me Thine abode,<br />
Jesu, bright and morning star.<br />
Thou my joy, and friend indeed,<br />
Help in time of utmost need,<br />
Come, my Saviour, and relieve me<br />
From the woulds which deeply grieve me!</li>
  <li>These deep scars the iron yoke<br />
Of the law hath made in me,<br />
Oft, as with a hammer’s stroke,<br />
Crushing e’en my strongest plea.<br />
O how terrible the wrath<br />
Of my God and Judge, who hath<br />
Pierced me with a voice of thunder,<br />
Rending heart and reins asunder!</li>
  <li>Satan, too, his wiles doth ply,<br />
And denieth me all grace,<br />
As tho’ I must ever lie<br />
In his own accursed place;<br />
And what even worse than this<br />
Fills my cup with bitterness—<br />
My own conscience doth sore smite me,<br />
And with fangs of venom bite me.</li>
  <li>If, to ease my grief of mind,<br />
And to quench the hidden fire,<br />
I should join the worldly kind,<br />
Lo, I plunge into the mire!<br />
There is comfort, but no peace,<br />
Joy which makes my pains increase,<br />
Help which makes my burdens double,<br />
Friends who laugh at all my trouble.</li>
  <li>All the world hath is, at most,<br />
Empty chaff which flies away;<br />
Have I grandeur? ‘tis soon lost;<br />
Have I riches? what are they<br />
But a heap of sordid earth?<br />
Have I pleasure? what is ‘t worth?<br />
What gives joy to-day, to-morrow<br />
Disappointment brings and sorrow.</li>
  <li>Jesus Christ, in Thy sweet grace<br />
All I find that I can need;<br />
Comfort, joy, a resting-place,<br />
Where I may securely feed.<br />
Lighten me, Thou source of light,<br />
Ere my heart be broken quite;<br />
Comfort, strengthen, and revive me,<br />
Nor of Thy sweet sight deprive me.</li>
  <li>Heart, rejoice that thou art heard;<br />
Jesus comes to sup with thee;<br />
He draws nigh thee: speak the word;<br />
Let Him quickly welcomed be.<br />
Make all ready for the guest,<br />
Wholly give thyself to rest;<br />
Open all thy soul’s distresses,<br />
Tell Him all that pains or presses.</li>
  <li>See’st thou not that all goes right,<br />
Where thy feet were wont to slip?<br />
Hear’st thou not with rich delight<br />
Words of honey from His lip?<br />
The old dragon must refrain<br />
From attempts he sees are vain,<br />
And must, sorely bruised and wounded,<br />
Flee to his abyss confounded.</li>
  <li>Sweet is now thy life to thee;<br />
All thou wilt is thine, and more:<br />
Christ who gave Himself for thee<br />
Lays His riches at thy door.<br />
Thy crown’s jewel is His grace,<br />
And thy heart His dwelling-place;<br />
Bound by bonds which none can sever,<br />
His is now thy spouse for ever.</li>
  <li></li>
