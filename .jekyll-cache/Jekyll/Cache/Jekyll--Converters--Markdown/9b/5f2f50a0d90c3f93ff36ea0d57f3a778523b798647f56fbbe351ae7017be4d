I" <p>The unusual figures in this Passion Hymn have prevented its receiving in English-speaking countries the wide popularity attained by <a href="/hymns/024">O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden</a>. Yet because of its dealing with a theme that appealed so strongly to Gerhardt and its being so characteristic of his piety and simplicity, a glimpse into the treatment accorded it by English translators should not be without interest. With hardly less depth of feeling than in â€œO Haupt voll Blut und Wundenâ€ but with stranger imagery Gerhardt portrays the passion of Christ and reflects upon its significance, and the comfort the Christian derives from it.</p>

<p>The <em>Moravian Hymn Book</em> contains <a href="/authors/gambold">Gamboldâ€™s</a> translation in Gerhardtâ€™s metre of nine of the ten stanzas; the seventh, which abounds in metaphors, he has omitted. Mention has elsewhere been made of Gerhardtâ€™s familiarity of tone in addressing the Savior. Gambold equals his master in this respect; witness stanza 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whilst I live here, I never shall<br />
Forget thy Grace amazing;<br />
Our love shall be reciprocal,<br />
I also Thee embracing.<br />
My heartâ€™s Light thou shalt be always,<br />
And when it breaks once (as one says)<br />
Thouâ€™lt be my Heart thenceforwardâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The figure in the concluding stanza of the bride clothed in purple is rather spoiled by Gambold by the baldness of the couplet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thy Blood shall of my Wedding-dress<br />
Be then the only splendor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nor have we in the German anything to suggest the final lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then will the Mother, who bore me,<br />
And nursed me up, my Lamb, for thee,<br />
Present me as thy Purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/authors/russell">Russellâ€™s</a> short version of two stanzas presents an effective paraphrase of the last three lines of Gerhardtâ€™s stanza IV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O sÃ¼szes Lamm, was soll ich dir<br />
Erweisen dafÃ¼r, dasz du mir<br />
Erweisest so viel Gutes?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>O Lamb beloved! How shall I Thee<br />
Requite for all, thus unto me<br />
Such wondrous goodness showing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the title â€œThe sin-bearing Lambâ€ <a href="/authors/guthrie">Dr. Guthrie</a> gives in his <em>Sacred Lyrics</em> perhaps the most readable English translation, as it combines Gerhardtâ€™s beautiful piety and spiritual simplicity; it is also unique among translations from the German, in that it introduces more of the direct address than is usual, translators preferring as a rule to render quotations in the indirect form: â€œGive me,â€ he says, â€œthe wreath of thorn,â€ etc.</p>

<p>Stanza 7, which Gambold omitted entirely, is the beginning of a hymn in Reidâ€™s <em>Praise Book.</em> It is a cento taken from <a href="/authors/charles">Mrs. Charlesâ€™</a> very free translation (1858) and is cited here to illustrate the liberties often taken by translators. Here, of course, the free paraphrase is reasonably justifiable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Gerhardt</strong></p>

  <p>Erweitre dich, mein Herzensschrein,<br />
Du sollt ein Schatzhaus werden<br />
Der SchaÌˆtze, die viel groÌˆszer sein<br />
Als Himmel, Meer und Erden.<br />
Weg mit dem Gold Arabia!<br />
Weg Calmus, Myrrhen, Casia!<br />
Ich hab ein Bessers funden.<br />
Mein groszer Schatz, Herr Jesu Christ<br />
Ist dieses, was geflossen ist<br />
Aus deines Leibes Wunden.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mrs. Charles</strong></p>

  <p>Gate of my heart, fly open wideâ€” <br />
Shrine of my heart, spread forth;<br />
The treasure will in thee abide<br />
Greater than heaven and earth:<br />
Away with all this poor worldâ€™s treasures,<br />
And all this vain worldâ€™s tasteless pleasures,<br />
My treasure is in heaven;<br />
For I have found true riches now,<br />
My treasure, Christ, my Lord, art Thou,<br />
Thy blood so freely given!</p>
</blockquote>
