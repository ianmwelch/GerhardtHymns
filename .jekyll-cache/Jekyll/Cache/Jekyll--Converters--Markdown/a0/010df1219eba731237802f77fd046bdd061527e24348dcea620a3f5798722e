I"/<p><em>A responsive prayer based on Gerhardt’s <a href="/hymns/010">Nun laßt uns gehn und treten</a></em>.</p>

<p>Heavenly Father,  <br />
let us come to you now in song and prayer,<br />
the Lord of our life, who alone gives us strength.</p>

<p>We journey and wander from day to day,<br />
and live and thrive from one year to the next—</p>

<p><strong>through depression and plague, through fear and trepidation,<br />
through war and great horrors that cover the whole world.</strong></p>

<p>For just as faithful mothers diligently protect their children<br />
in severe storms here on earth,</p>

<p><strong>so much more do you keep your children safe<br />
when distress and tribulation strike.</strong></p>

<p>O Protector of our life, everything we do is surely in vain<br />
unless under your careful watch.</p>

<p><strong>Blessed is your faithfulness, which is new every morning.<br />
Praise be to your delicate hands, which mend our heart’s sorrows.</strong></p>

<p>We ask you, O Father, that you remain a fountain of joy<br />
in the midst of our sufferings and the cross we bear.</p>

<p><strong>Give me and all those whose hearts yearn<br />
for you and your favor, a heart that is patient.</strong></p>

<p>Close the gates of lament and let streams of joy flow over<br />
all the places that have endured so much bloodshed.</p>

<p><strong>Give your gentle blessing to all of our ways,<br />
and let the radiance of your grace shine on both great and small.</strong></p>

<p>Be a father for the abandoned, counselor for the guilty,<br />
gift for those without aid, and a possession for the poor.</p>

<p><strong>Be a gracious help to all who are sick and give cheerful thoughts<br />
to the afflicted souls that are tormented with sadness.</strong></p>

<p>And finally, most importantly of all, fill us with your Spirit,<br />
that he may adorn us with splendor and lead us heavenward.</p>

<p><strong>Grant all this, O Life of my life,<br />
to me and to the multitudes of Christians this blessed new year. Amen.</strong></p>
