<ol>
  <li>Oh, how shall I receive Thee:<br />
how meet Thee on Thy way<br />
Blest hope of every nation;<br />
my soulâ€™s delight and stay!<br />
O Jesu ! Jesu ! give me,<br />
now by Thy own pure light,<br />
To know whateâ€™er is pleasing,<br />
and welcome in Thy sight.</li>
  <li>Thy Sion palms is strewing,<br />
and branches fresh and fair;<br />
My heart to praise awaking,<br />
her anthem shall prepare.<br />
Perpetual thanks and praises,<br />
forth from my heart shall spring;<br />
to Thy name the service<br />
of all my powers will bring.</li>
  <li>O ye who sorrow, sinking<br />
beneath your grief and pain,<br />
Rejoice in His appearing<br />
who shall your souls sustain:<br />
He comes, He comes with gladness:<br />
how great is His good-will!<br />
He comes; all grief and anguish<br />
shall at His word be still.</li>
  <li>Ye who with guilty terror<br />
are trembling, fear no more:<br />
With love and grace the Saviour<br />
shall you to hope restore.<br />
He comes: He comes, who sinners<br />
shall with the children place,<br />
The children of His Father,<br />
the heirs of life and grace!</li>
  <li>He comes! the Lord to judgment!<br />
His foes His wrath shall feel:<br />
To those who love and seek Him,<br />
that day will grace reveal.<br />
Descend, descend, O Saviour!<br />
and gather us to Thee,<br />
That in the light eternal<br />
our joyous home may be.</li>
</ol>
