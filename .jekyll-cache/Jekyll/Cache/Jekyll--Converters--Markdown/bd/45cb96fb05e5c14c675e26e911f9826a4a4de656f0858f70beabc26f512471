  <li>
    <p>Wherefore dost Thou longer tarry,<br />
Blessed of the Lord, afar?<br />
Would it were Thy will to enter<br />
To my heart, O Thou my Star,<br />
Thou my Jesus, Fount of pow’r,<br />
Helper in the needful hour!<br />
Sharpest wounds my heart is feeling,<br />
Touch them, Saviour, with Thy healing!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For I shrink beneath the terrors<br />
Of the law’s tremendous sway;<br />
All my countless crimes and errors<br />
Stand before me night and day.<br />
Oh the heavy, fearful load<br />
Of the righteous wrath of God!<br />
Oh the awful voice of thunder<br />
Cleaving heart and soul asunder!</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Would I then, to soothe my sorrow,<br />
And my pain awhile forget,<br />
From the world a comfort borrow,<br />
I but sink the deeper yet,<br />
She hath comforts that but grieve,<br />
Joys that stinging memories leave,<br />
Helpers that my heart are breaking,<br />
Friends that do but mock its aching.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>All delight, all consolation<br />
Lies in Thee, Lord Jesus Christ,<br />
Feed my soul with Thy salvation,<br />
O Thou Bread of Life unpric’d.<br />
Blessed Light, within me glow,<br />
Ere my heart breaks in its woe;<br />
Oh refresh me and uphold me,<br />
Jesu, come, let me behold Thee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Joy, my soul, for He hath heard thee,<br />
He will come and enter in;<br />
Lo! He turns and draweth toward thee,<br />
Let thy welcome-song begin!<br />
Oh prepare thee for such guest,<br />
Give thee wholly to thy rest,<br />
With an open’d heart adore Him,<br />
Pour thy griefs and fears before Him.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>What would seem to hurt or shame thee<br />
Shall but work thy good at last;<br />
Since that Christ hath deign’d to claim thee,<br />
And His truth stands ever fast;<br />
And if thine can but endure,<br />
There is nought so fixed and sure,<br />
As that thou shalt hymn His praises<br />
In the happy heavenly places.</li>
</ol>
