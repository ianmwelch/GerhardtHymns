  <li>
    <p>Ah! Lord, how shall I meet Thee,<br />
How welcome Thee aright?<br />
All nations long to greet Thee,<br />
My hope, my sole delight!<br />
Brighten the lamp that burneth<br />
But dimly in my breast,<br />
And teach my soul, that yearneth<br />
To honour such high guest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thy Zion strews before Thee<br />
Her fairest buds and palms,<br />
And I too will adore Thee<br />
With sweetest songs and psalms;<br />
My soul breaks forth in flowers<br />
Rejoicing in Thy fame,<br />
And summons all her powers<br />
To honour Jesus’ name.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Nought, nought, dear Lord, could move Thee<br />
To leave Thy rightful place<br />
Save love, for which I love Thee;<br />
A love that could embrace<br />
A world where sorrow dwelleth,<br />
Which sin and suffering fill,<br />
More than the tongue e’er telleth;—<br />
Yet Thou couldst love it still!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>O ye sad hearts that sicken<br />
With hope deferred, and see<br />
The gloom around you thicken,<br />
The joys ye hoped for flee,—<br />
Despair not, He is near you,<br />
Yea, at the very door,<br />
Who best can help and cheer you,<br />
He will not linger more.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor sin shall make you fearful,<br />
Ashamed to see His face,<br />
The contrite heart and tearful<br />
He covers with His grace;<br />
He comes to heal the spirit<br />
That moumeth sin-oppressed,<br />
And raise us to inherit<br />
With Him our proper rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>He comes to judge the nations,<br />
   A terror to His foes,<br />
   A light of consolations<br />
   And blessed hope to those<br />
   Who love the Lord’s appearing:<br />
   O glorious Sun, now come,<br />
   Send forth Thy beams of cheering<br />
   And guide us safely home!</li>
</ol>
