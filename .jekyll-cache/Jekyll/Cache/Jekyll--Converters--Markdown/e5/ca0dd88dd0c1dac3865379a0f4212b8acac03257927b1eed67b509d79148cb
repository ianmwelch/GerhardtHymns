I"Ì<p>Intended to be sung the first Sunday in Advent, this hymn was first included in <a href="/authors/cr√ºger">Cr√ºger‚Äôs</a> <em>Praxis pietatis melica</em>, 1653, no. 81, in 10 stanzas of 8 lines. It later appeared in <a href="/authors/ebeling">Ebeling‚Äôs</a> <em>Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten</em>, 1666/67, no. 49, and in <a href="/authors/feustking">Feustking‚Äôs</a> <em>Pauli Gerhardi Geistreiche Hauss- und Kirchen-Lieder</em>, 1707, p. 1.</p>

<p>Gerhardt bases this hymn on the <em>Hildebrandslied</em> (Song of Hildebrand, c. 830)‚Äîone of the earliest Germanic poems‚Äîusing two cross rhymes. The meter and rhyme scheme are popular in folk and church songs at the time. However, in contrast to medieval poetry, alliteration is sparse (e.g., ‚Äúda Fried und Freude lacht‚Äù).</p>

<p>The stanzas consist of two cross-rhymes, alternating soft and hard endings. The hymn uses four paired lines: the climax being in the caesura after the second pair.  The caesura is followed by a declaration and call to prayer (e.g., ‚ÄúO Jesu, Jesu,‚Äù ‚Äúer kommt, er kommt,‚Äù and ‚Äúach komm, ach komm‚Äù).</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>The hymn is divided in two parts: Stanzas 1‚Äì5 and 6‚Äì10. The first part is prayerfully addressed to Jesus‚Äîcharacterized by the verbs ‚Äúempfangen‚Äù (to receive) and umfangen (to embrace). They unfold as an individual address to the coming Christ God‚Äôs unconditional devotion to human beings, as recognized by the Lutheran doctrine of justification. This is done with reference to the parable of the wise and foolish virgins (Matthew 25:1-15) with ‚Äúdie Fackel‚Äù (the torch) in stanza 1 and by implementing the pericope of the first Sunday in Advent, Jesus‚Äô entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1-9) in stanza 2. Gerhardt now calls on Jesus to enter into the heart of the Christians.</p>

<p>Stanzas 6 to 10 address the congregation as a pastoral encouragement, portraying it as being in grief, distress, terror and hostility. This is done with special reference to the approaching Last Judgment depicted in John‚Äôs Revelation (stanza 6: the Coming One ‚Äústands at the door,‚Äù Rev 3:20), and in stanzas 7 to 10 the concept of Advent (Latin: ‚Äúarrival,‚Äù Rev 22:20) is unfolded fourfold: He comes by grace, as Savior, as King and as Judge.</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>

<p>The translations that have endured in American hymnals are adaptations of Jacobi, Russell, and Winkworth‚Äîparticularly from Mercer‚Äôs <em>Church Psalter and Hymn Book</em> and Winkworth‚Äôs <em>Chorale Book of England</em>. Most occurances of this hymn are limited to less than six stanzas of the original ten. Hewitt offers a <a href="/appendix/hewitt/001-hewitt">commentary</a> on some of the early English translations.</p>
