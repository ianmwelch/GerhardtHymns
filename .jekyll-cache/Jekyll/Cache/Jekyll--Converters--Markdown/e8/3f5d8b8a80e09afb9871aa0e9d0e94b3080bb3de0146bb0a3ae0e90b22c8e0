I"è<p>Rev. Robert Maguire D. D. (1826-1890), controversialist, born in Dublin 3 March 1826, was son of William Maguire of Dublin, inspector of taxes there, and was educated at Trinity College, where he graduated B.A. 1847, M.A. 1855, and B.D. and D.D. 1877. On Trinity Sunday 1849 he was ordained to the curacy of St. Nicholas‚Äô parish, Cork. In 1852 he became clerical secretary to the Islington Protestant Institute, which had for its object ‚Äòthe awakening of Protestant Christians to the progress of Popery.‚Äô Maguire‚Äôs efforts increased the number of members from six hundred to fourteen hundred. In a controversy with Frederick Oakeley, Roman catholic priest of Islington, and his schoolmaster, Mr. Weale, Maguire published in 1853 a pamphlet entitled ‚ÄòThe Early Irish Church independent of Rome till A.D. 1172,‚Äô which had a large sale. In July 1856 he was elected Sunday afternoon lecturer at St. Luke‚Äôs, Old Street, and in the following October perpetual curate of St. James‚Äôs, Clerkenwell, one of the few livings to which the parishioners themselves have the right to present. His election led to legal proceedings, and he was not inducted till 3 May 1857. While at Clerkenwell he soon became popular as a preacher and lecturer, and distinguished himself in a controversy with the National Sunday League. He was appointed morning lecturer at St. Swithin, Cannon Street, in 1864, and rector of St. Olave, Southwark, in 1875. He died at Eastbourne on 3 Sept. 1890.</p>
