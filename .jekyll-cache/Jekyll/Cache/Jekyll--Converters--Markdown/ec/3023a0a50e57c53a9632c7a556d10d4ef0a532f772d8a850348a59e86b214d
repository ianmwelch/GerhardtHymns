I"Ì<p>The earliest accessible English version is that of <a href="/authors/jacobi_j">Jacobi</a>, 1725, printed in the 1754 <em>Moravian Hymn Book.</em> The translations by this author are usually very crude and painfully laborious, but in the present case, with a few notable exceptions, he has very well caught the ring and spirit of Gerhardt. Later compilers and publishers of hymns would of course omit the lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œHis Grace has cleansed and polished<br />
My humble Soul within.â€ (stanza 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAll this I have digested.â€ (stanza 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like many of the early translators of German hymns Jacobi is guilty of frequent imperfect rhymes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Stanza 4</th>
      <th>Stanza 14</th>
      <th>Stanza 15</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Merit</td>
      <td>spectre</td>
      <td>alone</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>spirit</td>
      <td>conjecture</td>
      <td>begun</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If we overlook these defects the version is one of the best that has appeared so far in English or American hymnals and considerably above the standard of the Moravian hymns of the early eighteenth century. The following lines offer a very true counterpart of the German:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAll woes give way and flee,â€ line 4</p>

  <p>â€œAnd that in Change and Chances<br />
He stands at my right hand.â€ lines 13, 14</p>

  <p>â€œThe ground of my possession<br />
Is Jesus and his Blood.â€ lines 17, 18</p>

  <p>â€œShould Earth lose its foundation<br />
Thou standâ€™st my lasting Rock.â€ lines 97, 98</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bishop Ryle in taking over this version into his <em>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</em> has made a number of alterations, presenting a cento of four stanzas. His stanza 3, for example, is a combination of Jacobiâ€™s last quatrain of stanza 9 and first quatrain of stanza 10:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Ryle (stanza 3)</th>
      <th>Jacobi (stanza 9)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>For me there is provided  <br />A city fair and new;  <br />To it I shall be guided,â€”  <br />Jerusalem the true!</td>
      <td>And how he hath provided  <br />A city new and fair  <br />Where things, our Faith did credit  <br />Shall to our eyes appear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Â </td>
      <td><strong>(stanza 10)</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>My portion there is lying,  <br />A destined Canaan lot;  <br />Though I am daily dying,  <br />My Canaan withers not.</td>
      <td>My portion there is lying  <br />A destinâ€™d Canaan-lot  <br />Thoâ€™ I am daily dying,  <br />My Heaven withers not.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>American congregations are familiar with the hymn:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Since</td>
      <td>Jesus</td>
      <td>is</td>
      <td>my friend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(If)</td>
      <td>Â </td>
      <td>(be)</td>
      <td>Â </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I to him belong . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is often called â€œThe Rest of Faith,â€ and is a cento of <a href="/authors/winkworth_c">Miss Winkworthâ€™s</a> very excellent version. Although she has not preserved the metre of the poem Miss Winkworth has thoroughly caught its spirit even imitating in the widely known last stanza the sound sequence and alliteration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My heart for gladness springs,<br />
It cannot more be sad,<br />
For very joy it laughs and sings,<br />
Sees nought but sunshine glad.<br />
The sun that glads mine eyes<br />
Is Christ the Lord I love,<br />
I sing for joy of that which lies<br />
Stored up for us above.</p>
</blockquote>
