1. Wherefore dost Thou, blest of God  
   Stand without and dwell afar?  
   Deign to make me Thine abode,  
   Jesu, bright and morning star.  
   Thou my joy, and friend indeed,  
   Help in time of utmost need,  
   Come, my Saviour, and relieve me  
   From the woulds which deeply grieve me!
   
2. These deep scars the iron yoke  
   Of the law hath made in me,  
   Oft, as with a hammer's stroke,  
   Crushing e'en my strongest plea.  
   O how terrible the wrath  
   Of my God and Judge, who hath  
   Pierced me with a voice of thunder,  
   Rending heart and reins asunder!
   
3. Satan, too, his wiles doth ply,  
   And denieth me all grace,  
   As tho' I must ever lie  
   In his own accursed place;  
   And what even worse than this  
   Fills my cup with bitternessâ€”  
   My own conscience doth sore smite me,  
   And with fangs of venom bite me.
   
4. If, to ease my grief of mind,  
   And to quench the hidden fire,  
   I should join the worldly kind,  
   Lo, I plunge into the mire!  
   There is comfort, but no peace,  
   Joy which makes my pains increase,  
   Help which makes my burdens double,  
   Friends who laugh at all my trouble.
   
5. All the world hath is, at most,  
   Empty chaff which flies away;  
   Have I grandeur? 'tis soon lost;  
   Have I riches? what are they  
   But a heap of sordid earth?  
   Have I pleasure? what is 't worth?  
   What gives joy to-day, to-morrow  
   Disappointment brings and sorrow.
   
6. Jesus Christ, in Thy sweet grace  
   All I find that I can need;  
   Comfort, joy, a resting-place,  
   Where I may securely feed.  
   Lighten me, Thou source of light,  
   Ere my heart be broken quite;  
   Comfort, strengthen, and revive me,  
   Nor of Thy sweet sight deprive me.
   
7. Heart, rejoice that thou art heard;  
   Jesus comes to sup with thee;  
   He draws nigh thee: speak the word;  
   Let Him quickly welcomed be.  
   Make all ready for the guest,  
   Wholly give thyself to rest;  
   Open all thy soul's distresses,  
   Tell Him all that pains or presses.
   
8. See'st thou not that all goes right,  
   Where thy feet were wont to slip?  
   Hear'st thou not with rich delight  
   Words of honey from His lip?  
   The old dragon must refrain  
   From attempts he sees are vain,  
   And must, sorely bruised and wounded,  
   Flee to his abyss confounded.
   
9. Sweet is now thy life to thee;  
   All thou wilt is thine, and more:  
   Christ who gave Himself for thee  
   Lays His riches at thy door.  
   Thy crown's jewel is His grace,  
   And thy heart His dwelling-place;  
   Bound by bonds which none can sever,  
   His is now thy spouse for ever.
