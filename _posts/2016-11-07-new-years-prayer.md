|      | Heavenly Father,                         |
| 1    | let us come to you now in song and prayer, |
|      | the Lord of our life, who alone gives us strength. |
|      |                                          |
| 2    | We journey and wander from day to day,   |
|      | and live and thrive from one year to the next — |
| 3    | **through fear and plague, through shivering and trembling,** |
|      | **through war and great horrors that cover the whole world.** |
|      |                                          |
| 4    | For just as faithful mothers diligently protect their children |
|      | in severe storms here on earth,          |
| 5    | **so much more do you keep your children safe** |
|      | **when distress and tribulation strike.** |
|      |                                          |
| 6    | O Protector of our life, everything we do is surely in vain |
|      | unless under your careful watch.         |
| 7    | **Blessed is your faithfulness, which is new every morning.** |
|      | **Praise be to your delicate hands, which mend our heart’s sorrows.** |
|      |                                          |
| 8    | We ask you, O Father, that you remain a fountain of joy |
|      | in the midst of our sufferings and the cross we bear. |
| 9    | **Give me and all those whose hearts yearn** |
|      | **for you and your favor, a heart that is patient.** |
|      |                                          |
| 10   | Close the gates of lament and let streams of joy flow over |
|      | all the places that have endured so much bloodshed. |
| 11   | **Give your gentle blessing to all of our ways,** |
|      | **and let the radiance of your grace shine on both great and small.** |
|      |                                          |
| 12   | Be a father for the abandoned, counselor for the guilty, |
|      | gift for those without aid, and a possession for the poor. |
| 13   | **Be a gracious help to all who are sick and give cheerful thoughts** |
|      | **to the afflicted souls that are tormented with sadness.** |
|      |                                          |
| 14   | And finally, most importantly of all, fill us with your Spirit, |
|      | that he may adorn us with splendor and lead us heavenward. |
| 15   | **Grant all this, O Life of my life,**   |
|      | **to me and to the multitudes of Christians this blessed new year. Amen.** |
