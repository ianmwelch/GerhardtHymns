I am a designer, artist, musician, and composer living in southern Wisconsin.

After graduating Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary in 2010 and receiving a Master of Divinity degree, I decided to continue my education at San Diego State University to attain a Master of Music degree with empasis on music composition. I have served as the choral director and musician at Risen Savior in Chula Vista, California, and now serve as the lead graphic designer for the [WELS Hymnal Project](http://welshymnal.com). 

I also operate the liturgical media company, [Paramentics](http://paramentics.com), that focuses on producing well-designed graphics for churches and schools.
