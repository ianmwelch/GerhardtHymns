Johann Heinrich Feustking was born on March 7, 1672, in Stellau, the son of a pastor, Heinrich Feustking. From his father, he was trained in and enthusiastic for theology. In 1689, he attended the Johanneum in Hamburg and enrolled, first at the University of Rostock, and then at the University of Wittenberg in order to devote himself to the study of philosophy and theology. He would eventually become the superintendent and court chaplain to the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst in Zerbst. It was at Zerbst that Feustking became steward of the works of [Paul Gerhardt](/authors/gerhardt) by his son, Paul Friedrich Gerhardt. He published the entirety of Gerhardt's hymns in his [*Pauli Gerhardi Geistreiche Hauss- und Kirchen-Lieder*](/sources/pauli_feustking) in 1707. In 1709, he became professor of theology and preacher at the local Castle Church in Wittenberg. In that same year he became Dean of the Faculty of Theology and Vice-Rector of the University of Wittenberg. In 1710 he was appointed by the elector widow Anna-Sophie as a court chaplain and tutor to the prince-elector. In 1712 he was appointed as court preacher to the Saxon court at Gotha, where he worked until his death.
