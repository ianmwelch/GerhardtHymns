Gambold, John, M.A., was born 1711, graduated at Christ Church, Oxford, B.A. 1730, M.A. 1734. Taking Holy Orders, he became, about 1739, Vicar of Stanton Harcourt, Oxford- shire, but resigned 1742 and joined the United Brethren (Moravians) by whom he was chosen one of their bishops in 1754. He died in 1771. About 26 translations and 18 original hymns in the Moravian Hymn Book are assigned to him. One or two of his hymns, which were published by the Wesleys, have been claimed for them, but the evidence is in favor of Gambold. A collected edition of his works was published at Bath in 1789, and afterwards reprinted. 

He has translated:   

[12&emsp;Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld](/hymns/012)  
[13&emsp;O Welt, sieh hier dein Leben](/hymns/013)  
[24&emsp;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden](/hymns/024)
