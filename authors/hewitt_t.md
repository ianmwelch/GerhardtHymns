Theodore Brown Hewitt, Ph.D. (1881–1952) was a professor of German at Yale University and Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Born on December 5, 1881 in Hanover, Germany, he was the third child of four of John Haskell Hewitt, a professor and Williams College, and Mary Louisa Downing. He later became professor of German at the University of Buffalo and died in Buffalo, New York on November 26, 1952.

He is known for his many books on the German language and his dissertation on Paul Gerhardt, *Paul Gerhardt as a Hymn Writer and His Influence on English Hymnody*. In this work, Hewitt seeks to measure the influence of Gerhardt upon writers of hymns in England and America through translations and adaptations. The book includes references to translations of 84 of the then known 132 hymns of Paul Gerhardt.
