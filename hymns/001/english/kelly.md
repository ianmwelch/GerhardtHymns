1. Say with what salutations  
   Shall I Thine advent greet?  
   Desire of all the nations,  
   My Joy and Succour meet!  
   O Jesus! Jesus! lead me  
   On by Thy blessèd light;  
   What’s Thy delight thus guide me  
   To understand aright.
2. With palms doth Zion meet Thee,  
   Spreads branches in the way;  
   To raise my soul to greet Thee  
   Glad psalms I’ll sing to-day.  
   My heart shall blossom ever,  
   O’erflow with praises new,  
   And from Thy name shall never  
   Withhold the honour due.
3. What hast Thou e’er neglected  
   For my good here below?  
   When heart and soul dejected,  
   Were sunk in deepest woe,  
   When from Thy presence hidden,  
   Where peace and pleasure are,  
   Thou camest, and hast bidden  
   Me joy again, my Star!
4. In bitter bondage lying,  
   Thou com’st and sett’st me free;  
   ’Neath scorn and shame when sighing,  
   Thou com’st and raisest me.  
   Thy grace high honour gives me,  
   Abundance doth bestow,  
   That wastes not, nor deceives me  
   As earthly riches do.
5. No other impulse led Thee  
   To leave Thy throne above,  
   Upon Thine errand sped Thee,  
   But world-embracing love!  
   A love that deeply feeleth  
   The wants and woes of men,  
   No tongue its fulness telleth,  
   It passeth human ken.
6. In thy heart be this written,  
   Thou much afflicted band!  
   Who evermore art smitten  
   With griefs on every hand.  
   Fear not! let nothing grieve thee,  
   For help is at thy door,  
   He’ll consolation give thee,  
   Oil in thy wounds will pour.
7. No care nor effort either  
   Is needed day and night,  
   How thou may’st draw Him hither  
   In thine own strength and might.  
   He comes, He comes with gladness!  
   O’erflows with love to thee,  
   To chase away the sadness  
   He knows oppresseth thee.
8. Sin’s debt, the mighty burden  
   Let not thy heart affright;  
   The Lord will freely pardon,  
   His grace will cover quite.  
   He comes! He comes! Salvation  
   Proclaiming everywhere,  
   Secures His chosen nation  
   Their heritage so fair!
9. Thy foes why should they move thee?  
   Their wiles and rage are vain,  
   Thy Saviour, who doth love thee,  
   Will scatter them again.  
   He comes! a Conq’ror glorious,  
   He’ll scatter every band  
   Of foes—His course victorious  
   Too few they’re to withstand.
10. He comes to judge each nation;  
   Who curs’d Him, curse shall He;  
   With grace and consolation,  
   Who lov’d, receiv’d shall be.  
   Oh! come, Thou Sun, and lead us  
   To everlasting light,  
   Up to Thy mansions guide us  
   Of glory and delight.
