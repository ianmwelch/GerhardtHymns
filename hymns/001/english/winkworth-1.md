*Omits stanza 3 and is in a different meter (86 86 D) from the original.*  
<br>

1. How shall I meet Thee? How my heart  
   Receive her Lord aright?  
   Desire of all the earth Thou art!  
   My hope, my sole delight!  
   Kindle the lamp, Thou Lord, alone,  
   Half-dying in my breast,  
   And make Thy gracious pleasure known  
   How I may greet Thee best.  

2. Her budding boughs and fairest palms  
   Thy Zion strews around;  
   And songs of praise and sweetest psalms  
   From my glad heart shall sound.  
   My desert soul breaks forth in flowers,  
   Rejoicing in Thy fame;  
   And puts forth all her sleeping powers,  
   To honor Jesus’ name.  

3. 

4. In heavy bonds I languished long,  
   Thou com’st to set me free;  
   The scorn of every mocking tongue—  
   Thou com’st to honor me.  
   A heavenly crown Thou dost bestow,  
   And gifts of priceless worth,  
   That vanish not as here below  
   The riches of the earth.  

5. Nought, nought, dear Lord! had power to move  
   Thee from Thy rightful place,  
   Save that almighty wondrous Love  
   Wherewith Thou dost embrace  
   This weary world and all her woe,  
   Her load of grief and ill  
   And sorrow, more than man can know;  
   Thy love is deeper still.  

6. O write this promise in your heart,  
   Ye sad at heart, with whom  
   Sorrows fall thick, and joys depart,  
   And darker grows your gloom.  
   Despair not, for your help is near,  
   He standeth at the door  
   Who best can comfort you and cheer,  
   He comes, nor stayeth more.  

7. Vex not your souls with care, nor grieve  
   And labor longer thus,  
   As though your arm could ought achieve,  
   And bring Him down to us!  
   He comes, He comes with ready will,  
   By pity moved alone,  
   All pain to soothe, all tears to still,  
   To Him they all are known.  

8. Ye shall not shrink nor turn aside,  
   Fearing to see His face,  
   So deep your sins, for He will hide  
   The darkest with His grace.  
   He comes, He comes, to save from sin,  
   All sinners to release,  
   For all the sons of God to win  
   The heritage of peace.  

9. Why ask ye what the wicked faith.  
   Why heed his craft and spite?  
   The Lord destroys him with a breath,  
   He stands not in His sight.  
   Christ comes, He comes, as King to reign!  
   Then gather ye His foes,  
   From earth's far corners; yet in vain  
   Would ye His rule oppose.  

10. He comes to judge the earth, and ye  
   Who mock'd Him, feel His wrath;  
   But they who loved and fought Him see  
   His light o'er all their path.  
   O Sun of Righteousness! arise,  
   And guide us on our way,  
   To yon fair mansion in the skies  
   Of joyous, cloudless day.
