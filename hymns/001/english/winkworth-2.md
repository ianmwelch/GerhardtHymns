*Omits stanzas 3, 4, 7, and 9.*  
<br>

1. Ah! Lord, how shall I meet Thee,  
   How welcome Thee aright?  
   All nations long to greet Thee,  
   My hope, my sole delight!  
   Brighten the lamp that burneth  
   But dimly in my breast,  
   And teach my soul, that yearneth  
   To honour such high guest.  

2. Thy Zion strews before Thee  
   Her fairest buds and palms,  
   And I too will adore Thee  
   With sweetest songs and psalms;  
   My soul breaks forth in flowers  
   Rejoicing in Thy fame,  
   And summons all her powers  
   To honour Jesus' name.  

3. 

4. 

5. Nought, nought, dear Lord, could move Thee  
   To leave Thy rightful place  
   Save love, for which I love Thee;  
   A love that could embrace  
   A world where sorrow dwelleth,  
   Which sin and suffering fill,  
   More than the tongue e'er telleth;—  
   Yet Thou couldst love it still!  

6. O ye sad hearts that sicken  
   With hope deferred, and see  
   The gloom around you thicken,  
   The joys ye hoped for flee,—  
   Despair not, He is near you,  
   Yea, at the very door,  
   Who best can help and cheer you,  
   He will not linger more.  

7. 

8. Nor sin shall make you fearful,  
   Ashamed to see His face,  
   The contrite heart and tearful  
   He covers with His grace;  
   He comes to heal the spirit  
   That moumeth sin-oppressed,  
   And raise us to inherit  
   With Him our proper rest.  

9. 

10. He comes to judge the nations,  
   A terror to His foes,  
   A light of consolations  
   And blessed hope to those  
   Who love the Lord's appearing:  
   O glorious Sun, now come,  
   Send forth Thy beams of cheering  
   And guide us safely home!
