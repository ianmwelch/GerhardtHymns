1. Lord, how shall I be meeting,  
   And how shall I embrace  
   Thee, earth's desire, when greeting  
   My soul's adorning grace!  
   O Jesus, Jesus holding  
   Thyself the flame in sight,  
   Show how, thy beam beholding,  
   I may, my Lord, delight.  

2. Fresh palms thy Zion streweth,  
   And branches ever green,  
   And psalms my voice reneweth,  
   To raise my joy serene.  
   Such budding tribute paying,  
   My heart shall hymn thy praise,  
   Thy holy name obeying  
   With chiefest of my lays.  

3. What hast thou left ungranted,  
   To give me glad relief?  
   When soul and body panted  
   In utmost depth of grief,  
   In hour of degradation,  
   Thy peace and pity smiled,  
   Then thou, my soul’s salvation,  
   Didst happy make thy child.  

4. I lay in slavish mourning,  
   Thou cam’st to set me free;  
   I sank in shame and scorning,  
   Thou cam’st to comfort me.  
   Thou raised’st me to glory,  
   Bestowing highest good,  
   Not frail and transitory,  
   Like wealth on earth pursued.  

5. Naught, naught did send thee speeding  
   From mansions of the skies,  
   But love all love exceeding,  
   Love able to comprise  
   A world in pangs despairing,  
   Weighed down with thousand woes  
   That tongue would fail declaring,  
   But love doth last inclose.  

6. Grave on your heart this writing,  
   O band of mourners poor!  
   With pains and sorrows fighting,  
   That throng you more and more;  
   Dismiss the fear that sickens,  
   For lo! beside you see  
   Him who your heart now quickens  
   And comforts; here is he.  

7. Why should you be detained  
   In trouble day and night,  
   As though he must be gained  
   By arm of human might?  
   He comes, he comes all willing,  
   All full of grace and love.  
   Those woes and troubles stilling,  
   Well known to him above.  

8. Nor need ye tremble over  
   The guilt that gives distress.  
   No! Jesus all will cover  
   With grace and righteousness:  
   He comes, he comes, procuring  
   The peace of sin forgiven,  
   To all God’s sons securing  
   Their part and lot in heaven.  

9. Why heed ye then the crying  
   Of crafty foemen nigh?  
   Your Lord shall send them flying  
   In twinkling of an eye.  
   He comes, he comes, forever  
   A King, and earth’s fell band  
   Shall prove in the endeavor  
   Too feeble to withstand.  

10. He comes to judge the nations,  
   “Wroth if they wrathful prove,  
   With sweet illuminations  
   To those who seek and love.  
   Come, come, O Sun eternal,  
   And all our souls convey  
   To endless bliss supernal,  
   In yonder court of day.
