1. How shall I meet my Saviour?  
   How shall I welcome Thee?  
   What Manner of Behaviour  
   Is now requir'd of me?  
   Let thine Illumination  
   Set Heart and Hands aright,  
   That this my Preparation  
   Be pleasing in thy Sight.  
2. Thy Sion’s strowing Flowers  
   For Thee to tread upon;  
   I'll raise with all my Powers  
   More Notes than Unison,  
   To praise the King of Glory  
   With Psalms of Melody,  
   T’improve the Sacred Story  
   In Rhimes and Harmony.  
3. What hast thou not devised,  
   Lord! to retrieve my Loss,  
   When I was so disguised  
   By Sin, and Hellish Dross;  
   The Sense of lost Salvation  
   Quite drove me to Despair,  
   But thy own Incarnation  
   Brought my Redemption near.  
4. I lay in Fetters groaning,  
   Thou cam’st to set me free;  
   My Shame I was bemoaning,  
   With Grace thou cloathedst me  
   And raisest me to Glory,  
   Endow’st me with thy Bliss,  
   Which is not transitory  
   As worldly Treasure is.  
5. What caus'd thy Incarnation?  
   What brought Thee down to me?  
   Thy Love to my Salvation  
   Contriv’d my Liberty.  
   O Love, beyond Expression!  
   Wherewith thou dost embrace  
   Mankind in its Digression  
   From Thee, the Source of Grace.  
6. Let this Consideration  
   Chear up your troubled Heart,  
   Ye Sons of Desolation!  
   That feel the sinful Smart;  
   Take Courage, your Salvation  
   Stands waiting at the Door,  
   The Gospel Consolation  
   Is nearer than before.  
7. You need not strive nor labour  
   With any Human Strength  
   To draw his Love and Favour  
   To you desired Length;  
   He comes and shews how willing  
   He is to bless you all,  
   The Law he is fulfilling  
   To save you from the Fall.  
8. Be not cast down, nor frighted  
   At Sin, tho' ne'er so great;  
   No! Jesus is delighted  
   The Greatest Guilt t’abate.  
   He comes to raise all Sinners  
   From Death to Life and Bliss,  
   And make us new Beginners  
   To taste what Jesus is.  
9. You dare not fear the Clamour  
   Of Satan and his Clan,  
   The Word, his pow'rful Hammer,  
   Destroys their wicked Plan.  
   He comes as King of Glory,  
   Whose Nod confounds their Host;  
   He carries all before ye,  
   And baffles all their Boast.  
10. He comes to pass his Sentence  
   On all his Enemies.  
   But those of True Repentance  
   Shall meet with Love and Peace.  
   Come Prince of Grace and Wonder!  
   Fetch thy Beloved Home,  
   Reveal thy Glories yonder,  
   Thy longing Spouse says: Come!
