1. How shall I meet my Saviour?  
   How shall I welcome Thee?  
   What Manner of Behaviour  
   Is now requir'd of me?  
   Let thine Illumination  
   Set Heart and Hands aright,  
   That this my Preparation  
   Be pleasing in thy Sight.
2. Whilst with the gayest Flowers  
   Thy Sion strews the Way,  
   I'll raise with all my Powers  
   To Thee, a grateful Lay:  
   To Thee the King of Glory  
   I'll tune a Song Divine;  
   And make thy Love's bright Story  
   In graceful Numbers shine.
3. What hast thou not performed,  
   Lord, to retrieve my Loss,  
   While I was so deformed  
   By Sin and Hellish Dross?  
   The Sense of lost Salvation  
   Quite drove me to Despair,  
   But thy own Incarnation  
   Brought my Redemption near.
4. I lay in Fetters groaning,  
   Thou cam’st to set me free.  
   My Shame I was bemoaning;  
   With Grace thou cloathedst me.  
   Thou raisest me to Glory;  
   Endow’st me with thy Bliss,  
   Which is not transitory,  
   As worldly Treasure is.
5. What caus'd thy Incarnation?  
   What brought Thee down to me?  
   Thy Love to my Salvation  
   Contriv’d my Liberty.  
   O Love, beyond Expression!  
   Wherewith thou dost embrace  
   Mankind in its Digression  
   From Thee, the Source of Grace.
6. Let this Consideration  
   Heal up your Wounds within,  
   Ye Sons of Desolation,  
   That feel the Smart of Sin.  
   Take Courage, your Salvation  
   Stands waiting at the Door;  
   The Gospel Consolation  
   Is nearer than before.
7. 'Tis none of your Endeavour,  
   Nor any Mortal Care  
   Cou'd draw his Sov'reign Favour  
   To Sinners in Despair;  
   Uncall’d he comes with Gladness  
   To save you from the Fall,  
   And cure all Grief and Sadness  
   You're still opprest withal.
8. Be not cast down nor frighted  
   At Sin, tho' ne'er so great;  
   No! Jesus is delighted  
   The Greatest to remit.  
   He comes repenting Sinners  
   With Life and Love to crown;  
   And make them happy Winners  
   Of Glory like his own.
9. Then fear not ye the Clamour  
   Of Satan and his Clan;  
   The Word, his pow'rful Hammer,  
   Destroys their wicked Plan.  
   He comes as King of Glory,  
   Whose Nod confounds their Host;  
   He carries all before ye,  
   And baffles all their Boast.
10. He comes to pass his Sentence  
   On all his Enemies.  
   But Children of Repentance  
   Shall meet with Love and Peace.  
   Come, Prince of Grace and Wonder!  
   Fetch thy Beloved Home;  
   Reveal thy Glories yonder;  
   Thy longing Spouse says, Come!
