1. Lord, how shall I receive Thee  
   Thou joy of all the earth,  
   What entertainment give Thee  
   Befitting Thy great worth?  
   O kindle, Jesu, Jesu,  
   Thy lamp within my breast,  
   And show me how to please Thee,  
   And entertain Thee best.  

2. When Sion came to meet Thee,  
   She strewed Thy way with palms,  
   And I would also greet Thee  
   With joyful songs and psalms;  
   My heart, fresh trophies bringing  
   To scatter on Thy way.  
   Shall break forth into singing.  
   And praise Thee night and day.  

3. What comfort have I wanted  
   Thy pity could bestow,  
   When soul and body panted  
   Beneath their weight of woe?  
   When from me had been taken  
   My dream of earthly bliss,  
   Thou camest to awaken  
   A better joy than this.  

4. When left to pine and languish  
   In bonds and misery,  
   'Twas Thou who saw'st my anguish,  
   And came to set me free.  
   Thou raisedst me to honour,  
   And gav'st me riches too,  
   Which fly not from their owner,  
   As earthly riches do.  

5. Naught, naught but true compassion,  
   And pure unbounded love,  
   Drew Thee, for our salvation.  
   From Thy bright realms above;  
   A love which comprehended  
   Within its wide embrace  
   A world which had offended,  
   The sins of all our race.  

6. Let this be plainly written,  
   Ye mourners, on your heart,  
   When it is forely smitten,  
   And wrung with keenest smart;  
   Fear not, nor be dejected,  
   Your Helper is at hand,  
   The Saviour long expected  
   E'en at the door doth stand.  

7. Ye need not so bestir you,  
   And labour day and night,  
   As though to draw Him near you  
   By your own strength and might.  
   He comes, He comes with healing  
   For all the countless woes  
   Which human hearts are feeling,  
   Whereof He so well knows.  

8. Nor need the sins which grieve you  
   Your trembling souls appal;  
   No, Jesus will forgive you,  
   His grace can hide them all.  
   He comes to bring salvation  
   To every contrite heart,  
   On earth sweet consolation,  
   In heaven a better part.  

9. What though the proud blasphemer  
   Both threats and wiles employ,  
   A word from your Redeemer  
   Shall him at once destroy.  
   He comes, He comes with glory  
   And majesty arrayed,  
   Great kings shall bow before Him,  
   His foes all flee dismayed.  

10. He comes to judge the scorners  
   Who have despised His grace,  
   And comfort pious mourners  
   Who humbly feek His face.  
   Ah! come, sweet Sun, and light us  
   To those bright realms above,  
   And with Thyself unite us,  
   Who art all Light and Love.
