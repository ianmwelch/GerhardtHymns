1. Oh, how shall I receive Thee:  
   how meet Thee on Thy way  
   Blest hope of every nation;  
   my soul's delight and stay!  
   O Jesu ! Jesu ! give me,  
   now by Thy own pure light,  
   To know whate'er is pleasing,  
   and welcome in Thy sight.
2. Thy Sion palms is strewing,  
   and branches fresh and fair;  
   My heart to praise awaking,  
   her anthem shall prepare.  
   Perpetual thanks and praises,  
   forth from my heart shall spring;  
   to Thy name the service  
   of all my powers will bring.
3. O ye who sorrow, sinking  
   beneath your grief and pain,  
   Rejoice in His appearing  
   who shall your souls sustain:  
   He comes, He comes with gladness:  
   how great is His good-will!  
   He comes; all grief and anguish  
   shall at His word be still.
4. Ye who with guilty terror  
   are trembling, fear no more:  
   With love and grace the Saviour  
   shall you to hope restore.  
   He comes: He comes, who sinners  
   shall with the children place,  
   The children of His Father,  
   the heirs of life and grace!
5. He comes! the Lord to judgment!  
   His foes His wrath shall feel:  
   To those who love and seek Him,  
   that day will grace reveal.  
   Descend, descend, O Saviour!  
   and gather us to Thee,  
   That in the light eternal  
   our joyous home may be.
