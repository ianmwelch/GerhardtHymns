*Omits stanzas 3, 5, and 11.*  
<br>

1. Wherefore dost Thou longer tarry,  
   Blessed of the Lord, afar?  
   Would it were Thy will to enter  
   To my heart, O Thou my Star,  
   Thou my Jesus, Fount of pow'r,  
   Helper in the needful hour!  
   Sharpest wounds my heart is feeling,  
   Touch them, Saviour, with Thy healing!

2. For I shrink beneath the terrors  
   Of the law's tremendous sway;  
   All my countless crimes and errors  
   Stand before me night and day.  
   Oh the heavy, fearful load  
   Of the righteous wrath of God!  
   Oh the awful voice of thunder  
   Cleaving heart and soul asunder!

3. 

4. Would I then, to soothe my sorrow,  
   And my pain awhile forget,  
   From the world a comfort borrow,  
   I but sink the deeper yet,  
   She hath comforts that but grieve,  
   Joys that stinging memories leave,  
   Helpers that my heart are breaking,  
   Friends that do but mock its aching.

5. 

6. All delight, all consolation  
   Lies in Thee, Lord Jesus Christ,  
   Feed my soul with Thy salvation,  
   O Thou Bread of Life unpric'd.  
   Blessed Light, within me glow,  
   Ere my heart breaks in its woe;  
   Oh refresh me and uphold me,  
   Jesu, come, let me behold Thee.

7. Joy, my soul, for He hath heard thee,  
   He will come and enter in;  
   Lo! He turns and draweth toward thee,  
   Let thy welcome-song begin!  
   Oh prepare thee for such guest,  
   Give thee wholly to thy rest,  
   With an open'd heart adore Him,  
   Pour thy griefs and fears before Him.

8. 

9. 

10. 

11. 

12. What would seem to hurt or shame thee  
    Shall but work thy good at last;  
    Since that Christ hath deign'd to claim thee,  
    And His truth stands ever fast;  
    And if thine can but endure,  
    There is nought so fixed and sure,  
    As that thou shalt hymn His praises  
    In the happy heavenly places.
