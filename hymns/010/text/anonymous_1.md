1. Now let each humble creature  
   Adore the God of nature,  
   For his kind preservation  
   And daily new creation.
2. We stretch our life and wander  
   From year to year, and yonder  
   We live, keep on improving,  
   Till date and year's removing.
3. Thro' pains, thro' wants and errors,  
   Thro' dismal wars and terrors,  
   Thro' crosses, strifes and hurry,  
   That seem the world to worry.  
4. As in tempestuous weathers  
   The kind and carefull mothers,  
   With nature's swift affection  
   Run to their babes protection.  
5. No less our heav'nly lover  
   Is present with his cover,  
   When stormy winds are blowing,  
   To save his children going.  
6. Great guardian of our being,  
   In vain is our foreseeing,  
   With all our best care-taking,  
   Except thine eyes be waking.  
7. Blest be thy gracious favour,  
   Each morn renews its favour;  
   Blest be the hands asswaging  
   All heart-akes ne'er so raging.  
8. Hear, father, our petition,  
   Relieve our weak condition  
   Be still the source of gladness  
   In all our grief and sadness.  
9. Grant all thy true sojourners  
   And heavy laden mourners,  
   That own thy visitations,  
   An heart endo'd with patience.  
10. Remove our sad disorders,  
   And make in all our borders  
   Thy peace and truth together  
   To meet and kiss each other.  
11. Lord grant thy benedictions  
   To all good thoughts and actions,  
   To youth, and age declining,  
   Thy gracious sun be shining.  
12. Be thou the orphan's father;  
   The straying draw together;  
   Relieve the poor and scanty,  
   To all in want give plenty.  
13. Heal all, the sick and wounded;  
   The souls that are surrounded  
   With fearful thoughts and terrors,  
   Lord, rescue from their errors.  
14. But chiefly grant thy Spirit,  
   Thro' Christ's all saving merit,  
   To fill us with such graces  
   As lead to thine embraces.  
15. All this, we pray, be giving,  
   O life of all that's living!  
   To us and all that favor  
   Thy New Year's gift and favor.
