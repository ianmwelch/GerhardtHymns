1. Year after year commenceth,  
   And, as our life advanceth,  
   We, strength from Christ deriving,  
   Each year by faith are thriving.

4. As, in tempestuous weather,  
   A kind and tender mother  
   Her babe from harm protecteth,  
   And safely home conducteth;  
5. So shelters Christ our Saviour  
   His children by his favor,  
   And proves in each temptation  
   Their refuge and salvation.

11. Lord, grant thy benediction  
   To ev'ry thought and action;  
   On youth and age declining,  
   Thou Sun of grace be shining.

14. O keep our souls and senses  
   Under the influences  
   Of thy most Holy Spirit,  
   Until we heav'n inherit.  
15. O God of our salvation,  
   Withhold no kind donation  
   From us, but let us savor  
   In this new year thy favor.
