1. Now let us come and go  
   with singing and praying  
   to the Lord our life,  
   who has given us strength up to this point.  
2. We journey to and fro and wander  
   from one year to the next,  
   we live and thrive  
   from the old to the new;  
3. through so much fear and plagues,  
   through shivering and trembling,  
   through war and great horrors,  
   that cover the whole world.  
4. For just like faithful mothers  
   in severe storms  
   here on earth, the little children  
   are diligently protected:  
5. So also, at the very least,  
   God keeps his children  
   [safe] sitting on his lap  
   when distress and tribulation strike.  
6. O Protector of our lives,  
   everything we do and make  
   is surely in vain  
   unless your eyes watch over.  
7. Blessed is your faithfulness,  
   which is new each morning,  
   Praise be to your strong hands,  
   which mend our heartache.  
8. We ask you, O Father, that you  
   remain of fountain of joy  
   in the midst of our sufferings  
   and the cross we bear.  
9. Give me and all those  
   whose hearts yearn  
   for you and your favor,  
   a heart that is patient.  
10. Close the gates of lament  
   and let streams of joy  
   flow over  all the places  
   that have endured so much bloodshed.  
11. Give your gentle blessing  
   to all of our ways,   
   and let the radiance of your grace  
   shine on both great and small.  
12. Be a father for the abandoned,  
   counselor for the guilty,  
    gift for those without aid,  
   and a possession for the poor.  
13. Be a gracious help to all who are sick  
   and give cheerful thoughts  
    to the afflicted souls  
   that are tormented with sadness.  
14. And finally, most importantly of all,  
   fill us with your Spirit,  
   that he may adorn us with splendor  
   and lead us heavenward.  
15. Grant all this,  
   O Life of my life,  
   to me and to the multitudes of Christians  
   this blessed new year.
