## About This Book

The Gerhardt Hymnal is an online book and research project of [Ian Welch](http://ianmwelch.com). The purpose of this book is to catalogue all of the known hymns of [Paul Gerhardt](/authors/gerhardt), their translations, tunes, and general information about them. This book will serve those who wish to learn more about Gerhardt's hymns, promote their use in worship, or produce translations of their own.

## Gerhardt's German

The hymns of Paul Gerhardt are presented in modern German. Minor differences in spelling can be seen between the original publications of the text and what is common in Germany today. Notable deviations of the text between the works of [Crüger](/authors/crüger), [Ebeling](/authors/ebeling), and [Feustking](/authors/feustking) are provided in footnotes. It is quite possible that any changes made to the texts were revisions done by Gerhardt himself before his death.
