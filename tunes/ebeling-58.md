[Johann Ebeling](/authors/ebeling), in his [*Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten*](/sources/pauli_gerhardi), composed an original four-part musical setting for Gerhardt's "Nun laßt uns gehn und treten." The new tune ended up being used very little by churches, possibly due to the growing acceptance of [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nun lasst uns gott, dem herren</span>](/tunes/nun-lasst-uns) made popular by [Johann Crüger](/authors/crüger). Even Ebeling himself offered the option to sing the text with this tune in his book.
